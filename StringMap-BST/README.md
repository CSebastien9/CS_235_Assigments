I.Project Description: 
-This program simulates a MAP/Dictionary ADT that maps a key
 to a value, and offers efficient operations to add, retrieve,
 and delete values based on some key. In this Map, both the keys
 and values are strings due to its name StringMap. See Interface
 in StringMap.hpp for details.

II.Important Note:
- This program does not automatically generate any output. 
  main.cpp only contains assertions for the sole purpose of testing.


III.Run Instructions:
-FOR UNIX ENVIRONMENT-
Step1:
  g++ -o [name of executable of your choice] main.cpp
  for example:  g++ -o TestMap main.cpp
Step2:
	./[name of executable chosen]
	e.g.: ./TestMap

-For other compilers such as Xcode for example-
IMPORANT: Change #include "StringMap.cpp" to "#include "StringMap.hpp"


IV. Input/Output Files:
- Input:  n/a
- Output: n/a
